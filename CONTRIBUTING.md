# Contributing to Giretra

First off, thank you for being here. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a card game enthusiast, a designer, or someone who just found a typo, **you belong here and your contribution matters**.

## Every contribution counts

We mean it. Building a game like Giretra takes far more than writing code. Here are just some of the ways you can help:

- **Report a bug** - Ran into something weird? Open an issue. You don't need to know *why* it broke, just tell us *what* happened.
- **Suggest an idea** - Have a thought about gameplay, UI, or anything else? We want to hear it.
- **Fix a typo** - A one-character fix is a real contribution. Documentation matters.
- **Write or improve docs** - Help others understand the game rules, the codebase, or how to get started.
- **Design** - Icons, card art, layouts, color palettes, animations. We need people with an eye for visual things.
- **Translate** - Giretra is a Malagasy card game. Help us make it accessible in more languages.
- **Test** - Play the game, try to break it, and tell us what you find.
- **Review pull requests** - A fresh pair of eyes catches things the author missed.
- **Answer questions** - Help other contributors in issues. Sharing what you know is a gift.
- **Build a bot** - Create your own AI player and compete on the leaderboard (see below).

You don't need permission to start. Pick something that interests you and jump in.

## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/giretra/giretra/issues/new) with:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if you can)
- Screenshots or logs if relevant

Don't worry about formatting it perfectly. A rough description is infinitely better than silence.

### Suggesting features or improvements

Same place, open an issue. Label it as a suggestion if you can, or just say so in the title. Sketch it out however makes sense to you: words, wireframes, napkin drawings, whatever works.

### Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch from `main` (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message describing *what* and *why*
5. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request

For small fixes (typos, docs, config), feel free to skip the issue and go straight to a PR.

### Design contributions

If you're contributing visual work (icons, mockups, layouts), you can:

- Attach images directly to an issue or PR
- Describe your idea in words so we can work together to bring it to life
- Share a Figma/sketch link if that's your thing

No specific format required. We'll figure it out together.

## Build your own bot

Giretra supports custom AI bots that can connect to the platform and compete against other players. You can write your bot in any language you like.

Everything you need to get started, including the protocol specification, example bots, and how to register yours on the leaderboard, is available at **[giretra.com/build-your-bot](https://giretra.com/build-your-bot)**.

No prior experience with game AI is required. If you can make HTTP requests, you can build a bot.

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Be respectful. Assume good intentions. We're all here because we care about this project, and everyone deserves to feel welcome regardless of their background or experience level.

## Questions?

Open an issue with a `question` label (or just ask in the title). There are no stupid questions. If something is unclear, that's a documentation problem we should fix.

Thank you for contributing to Giretra. Every issue filed, every line changed, every idea shared makes this project better.
